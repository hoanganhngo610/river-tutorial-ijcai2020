# Welcome

This repository contains the notebooks for the "Machine learning for data streams with scikit-multiflow" tutorial for the IJCAI-PRICAI 2020 conference.

### Announcement
In November 2020, `scikit-muiltiflow` and `creme`, the two most popular open-source libraries for stream learning merged into a new library named `river`.
Accordingly, the notebooks are based on `river`, the title of the tutorial was not changed as the conference's program was already announced.

## Content
- `demo-river.ipynb` - Provides an overview of `river`, how to use it and extend/create functionality.
- `demo-visualization-hv.ipynb` - An advanced example for visualizing model performance in real time with `holoviews`.
